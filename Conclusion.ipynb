    "Although the data we analyzed points to Oakland being the “best” neighborhood, my personal favorites are Lawrenceville and East Liberty due the abundance of thrift stores and coffee shops in the area. If our sub-metrics that decided “bestness” were based on different criteria, such as access to unique local businesses, or restaurants, the results might have been different. This demonstrates how subjective “bestness” can be, depending on what factors are most important to an individual."
