    "Our project aims to highlight which neighborhood stands out as the best neigborhood to live in within the city of Pittsburgh based on datasets that regard specific city standards. Our approach as a team was to analyze several factors of different neighborhoods such as the quality of life, community opportunity/engagement, and a fun factor of the neighborhood. By comparing and evaluating these aspects, we've aquired a deeper understanding of why Oakland is the best neighborhood to live in and such a desirable place to call home."
